# Vue Week day two

* vue is a javascript framework 
* provides extra functionality in javascript that would usually take many lines
* in class we worked through an example that changed the css of a page
* for homework we are working on some code that will change the layout of images on a page between a grid and a list view

[here is the code from class](https://github.com/bootcamp-f17/vue-navigation-menu)

* we also were introduced to the turnary operation:
	- turnary operator (x?y:z)
	- shorthand for: if x is true then do y, if not do z
