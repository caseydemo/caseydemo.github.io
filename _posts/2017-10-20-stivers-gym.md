Stivers Strength Gym – a barbell social club 
(thats their line, not mine)

So this post is about a strength training gym – but let me be clear here, I’m not in shape at the moment of writing this. Far from it. However, I’m interested in getting in better shape and I am seeking a program I can get behind. I have a hard time with group exercise classes because I find the incessant “encouragement” incredibly annoying. Specifically when it comes to cardio. For some reason I am ok with somone pushing me to be stronger. It’s just when somone is pushing me to do a lunge to the best of my ability that I am like…. Man who cares? 

I digress - the point of this blog post is to discuss my experience on their website as a potential customer.  

Today I decided I wanted to get involved in some kind of group fitness class. I began my search by just typing some generic fitness keywords into the google-box. Without even really reading the sub-headings I just clicked on the links that came at the top of the searches. After sifting through four or five gyms here in lexington (some of whom their website was not so great) I came across Stivers strength gym.

Their site looked great. It was simple, easy to look at, easy to navigate, easy to understand… it was just easy! I loved how they had the majority of their content on a single long page that was split up between high quality pictures of the facility and customers, and easy to ready sections of text. They even showed through their pictures and logo that they had even chosen an aesthetic style. Kindof an old timey (please forgive my ignorance to actual style eras) 1920s weightlifter with a big curly mustache and round weights on the ends of his dumb-bell. I look at pictures of the facility and I can almost hear rag-timey music playing in the background. 

Kudos Stivers. Most gyms are just concrete and bar fluorescent  bulbs. This site sold me. If you find it important enough to put the time into the small details of the aesthetics of your gym, I have a good feeling you would put an appropriate amount of effort into helping me reach my fitness goals. 

But since this is supposed to be a at least somewhat technical blog post, here are some things I loved about their website: 

- simple, clear and effective text
- large high quality professional pictures (and lots of them)
- lots of testimonials
- easy to follow flow being on one long page
- contact info was very easy to get to
- just looked professional and complete

so great job, guy who developed their website! I’m a big fan!
