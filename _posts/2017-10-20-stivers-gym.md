<p class="blog-text"> Today I decided I wanted to get involved in some kind of group fitness class. I began my search by just typing some generic fitness keywords into the google-box. Without even really reading the sub-headings I just clicked on the links that came at the top of the searches. After sifting through four or five gyms here in lexington (some of whom their website was not so great) I came across Stivers strength gym.</p>

<p class="blog-text"> Their site looked great. It was simple, easy to look at, easy to navigate, easy to understand… it was just easy! I loved how they had the majority of their content on a single long page that was split up between high quality pictures of the facility and customers, and easy to ready sections of text. They even showed through their pictures and logo that they had even chosen an aesthetic style. Kindof an old timey (please forgive my ignorance to actual style eras) 1920s weightlifter with a big curly mustache and round weights on the ends of his dumb-bell. I look at pictures of the facility and I can almost hear rag-timey music playing in the background. </p>

<p class="blog-text"> Kudos Stivers. Most gyms are just concrete and bar fluorescent  bulbs. This site sold me. If you find it important enough to put the time into the small details of the aesthetics of your gym, I have a good feeling you would put an appropriate amount of effort into helping me reach my fitness goals.

<p class="blog-text">
These are some elements I loved about their website: 
<div class="blog-list">
	<div class="outer-blog-list">
		<ul> Simple, clear and effective text</ul>
		<ul> High quality professional pictures (and lots of them)</ul>
		<ul> Testimonials</ul>
		<ul> Natural flow on one page</ul>
		<ul> Easy access to contact info</ul>
		<ul> Professional and complete</ul>
	</div>
</div>
</p>

<p class="blog-text"> I referred to this website often when making my final project, Venue-Hunter. With everything on my site I made great efforts to always make the user experience easy. 

so great job, guy who developed their website! I’m a big fan!</p>
