## Structuring a Question

<!--more-->

so one thing I have learned in the bootcamp is how to properly ask a question. Or more specifically, how to structure the question process and document it properly. The question process is an opportunity to document what the problem is, what you think the solution is, what you've tried (so you know it doesn't work), and what you hope to get to happen. 


<h3> Document these four things:</h3>
1. Your definition of the problem (or what seems to be the problem)
2. The steps you have taken to solve the problem
	- console.logs, alerts, sample data, keywords from searches
3. What you want to have happen - in english
4. What you think might be the solution
