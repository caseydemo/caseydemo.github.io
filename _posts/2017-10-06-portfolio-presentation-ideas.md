## Comments & Suggestions

* experiment with different stlying
* add more content to About me page
* add a contact form (saves your email and personal stuff from being exposed)
* make sure all font-styling and color is readable against whatever background
* use icons from awesome-fonts for links instead of just words
* add a resume... I guess
* finish and refactor projects and include them into portfolio
	- tic tac toe
	- hangman (finished)
	- calculator
	- to do list
	- weather app
	- check out jekyll and see whats not working (alot of redundant code - especially in html files)
