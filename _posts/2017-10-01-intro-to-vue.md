# Week 3 - October 1

# things I have questions about

* asyncronous loading?
* variable key name?
* ajax - http requests?
* foreach syntax:
	
	// an array "a"
	var a = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

	// for each element within "a" call the function with element "element"
	a.forEach(function(element) {
	    console.log(element);
	});






## Stuff I kinda get
* div id="content" - is content a reserved word?
* "<html stuff>" - within javascript file
* do["some ting"] is syntactically the same as do.something
* array.reduce((a, b)=> a+b, ); --- this sums up all contents of an array
* Procfile tells heroku to run the script commands
* index.js "__dir + '/app'" --> this makes the app folder your home base
* Vue javascript framework
