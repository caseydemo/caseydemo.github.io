    <h1 id="page-title">Stubb It Out</h1>

  
<h3>Stubb it out</h3>

<p>So at bootcamp yesterday we discussed a problem solving process. It’s not called stubb it out… no now it’s called that. Yes. It’s called stubb it out. It follows a logical approach to solving a problem - probably the normal process any logical minded person would take naturally. However, while we were going over it I realized that I was blurring the lines in my own problem solving process and kindof getting things jumbled. In other words - instead of breaking down my coding endeavours into clearly defined bite-size chunks and going step and a time I was taking a fluid approach. And yeah, that wasn’t working too well. It actually reminded me of when I first started playing the drums.</p>

<p>It’s possible to play drums with poor technique and accomplish some degree of success. I guess. But - I was fortunate enough to have gotten proper teaching and training when I was younger on the drums. Looking back I don’t see how it could have been anything but frustrating to try and play something “cool” without having first taken the time to break down my technique. And my teachers made me break it down. Like - alot. Step by step. SLOWLY. When I sit down now to play - I just play.</p>

<p>I don’t think “alright - I’m gonna start with a down stroke in the right hand, followed by an up stroke in the right while maintaining my left hand’s position on the drum. But then when my right stick returns I need to prep my left hand for a full volume down stroke…”</p>

<p>But - there was a time. A LONG time when I forced myself to think that way. I see other drummers who did not take the time to break down their technique to each step and really own it and when they try to play sofistocated stuff… it makes me sad. Ain’t nobody wanna listen to that garbage - go practice.</p>

<p>Oh… I need to slow down and work on each step of my coding. Ohhhhh…..</p>

<p>So my paralell is that I don’t yet OWN the problem solving process with coding. I can rush through easy problems and try to keep the problem solving process all “in my head” and not on paper and defined. But pulling from the feelings I have towards drummers that skimp on technique - my coding must make experienced coders queasy. I am better than that. I gotta slow down. Something struck a note with me yesterday. I need to SLOW DOWN!</p>

<p>So here’s my basic recap of the process when prepping to code as I understand it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Define everything.</li>
  <li>What are the requirements?</li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the Minimum Viable Product?</p>
  </li>
  <li>Step through (with actual english words) what you THINK should happen at each step
    <ul>
      <li>Do this process several times - each iteration should be more refined</li>
      <li>Similar to the agile workflow (low fidelity -&gt; high fidelity)</li>
      <li>Try to define the “groupings” and look for patterns</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Go in to your actual project folder and STUBB IT OUT
    <ul>
      <li>This is the magic. Write a function for each thing you want to happen - even if you don’t have any earthly idea how to make that thing happen.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />
<p>function thingToHappen(){</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>// short description of what you want to happen }
</code></pre>
</div>

<hr />

<ol>
  <li>Mentally step throug your stubb steps
    <ul>
      <li>At this point you’ll start to see
        <ul>
          <li>connections between functions</li>
          <li>Redundant functions</li>
          <li>Possibly a completely different approach</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ATTEMPT to put logic into functions step by step
    <ul>
      <li>Identify methods and processes that you have used in the past (vocabulary, previous projects, bag of tricks etc)</li>
      <li>THERE WILL BE THINGS YOU DON’T KNOW HOW TO SOLVE HERE!!!</li>
      <li>Define those things as specifically as you can and RESEARCH</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Rinse and Repeat</li>
</ol>

<p>My issue is not defining what I DON’T know clearly enough. That is my challenge. This is a good starting place. I want to learn how to do this right and not rush through lacking any technique. Let’s go.</p>
