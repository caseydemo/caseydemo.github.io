      <p style="text-indent: 40px">After studying percussion and music merchandising at Eastern Kentucky University, I've spent the last decade working in the music industry. Working at times as a performer, educator, sound engineer and salesperson and I've had the opportunity to meet some very cool people and experience some very cool things. But my newest adventure is being a Dad.  </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">Two years ago my life changed completely for the better when my son was born. And as much as I love music, I found it difficult to justify the time spent away from my family. I want to be around to help him grow up as much as possible. So recently I made the decision to attend the Awesome Inc Web Developer Bootcamp and change career paths. </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">The boot camp has taught me many things that will help me achieve my goal of being a web developer, but most of all it's given me confidence that I can learn just about anything with the tools available to me. No challenge is too complex when you know how to break apart a problem and incrementally solve it. I'll be forever grateful to the educators at Awesome Inc. </p>
